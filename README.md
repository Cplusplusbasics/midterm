# Midterm-Project
Problem #3

3.	Create a C++ program that will advise a student of whether he/she needs to take the final based upon their midterm grade:

  a.	If the student has an ‘A’, they will NOT have to take the final and advise them their grade was excellent. 
  
  b.	If the student has a ‘B’, they will NOT have to take the final and advise them their grade was very good.
  
  c.	If the student has a ‘C’, they will have to take the final and advise them of such and use a message of passing.
  
  d.	If the student has a D or F, they will have to take the final and advise them of such and use a message – not good, go study.
